You can configure your project's behavior in the **Settings** tab of the dashboard.

## General

- **Name**: The display name of your project.
- **Domain**: The base domain for your webhook endpoints. This is only optional for local development projects that don't have a domain yet. When set, you can use relative paths when scheduling hooks.
- **Custom Authorization Header**: An optional value (e.g., `Bearer my-token`) that Posthook will include in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Retries

Control how Posthook handles failures (non-200 responses or timeouts).

- **Max Retries**: Choose between 1 and 10 attempts.
- **Retry Delay**: Choose how long to wait between attempts (5 to 60 seconds).

<Tip>
  Use a shorter delay for time-sensitive hooks, and a longer delay if your endpoint needs time to recover.
</Tip>

## Notifications

Get notified when a hook fails permanently (i.e., fails all retry attempts).

1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**.
2. Add an email address.
3. Posthook will send an email alert whenever a hook in this project reaches its final failure state.

## WebSocket Delivery (Beta)

WebSocket delivery allows you to receive webhooks on your local machine without exposing a public IP or using tools like ngrok.

1. Toggle **WebSocket Delivery** on.
2. Run the CLI command provided:
   ```bash
   npx posthook listen --api-key <YOUR_KEY> --forward http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Posthook will accept your scheduled hooks and immediately push them down the WebSocket connection to your CLI, which forwards them to your localhost.

<Note>
  This is intended for development only. For production, we recommend using standard HTTPS delivery.
