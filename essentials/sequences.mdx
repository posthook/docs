title: 'Sequences'
description: 'Chain hooks together with dependencies'
---

Sequences allow you to define a workflow of multiple hooks that run in a specific order. You can define dependencies between steps, ensuring `Step B` only runs after `Step A` succeeds.

## How it works

A sequence is defined by:
1. **Start Time**: When the first step(s) should kick off.
2. **Interval**: How often the sequence repeats (optional).
3. **Steps**: A collection of hooks to fire.

## Configuration

Sequences are configured using YAML. Each key in the YAML object represents a step name.

### Example

Here is a common pattern for a data synchronization workflow:

```yaml
syncData:
  path: /webhooks/posthook/sync
cleanupOldRecords:
  path: /webhooks/posthook/cleanup
notify:
  path: /webhooks/posthook/notify
  requires:
    - syncData
    - cleanupOldRecords
```

### Breakdown
- **syncData** and **cleanupOldRecords** have no `requires` field, so they start immediately in parallel.
- **notify** waits until *both* `syncData` and `cleanupOldRecords` have successfully completed (returned 200 OK).
- If any dependency fails, the dependent steps (like `notify`) will not run.

## Managing Sequences

You can create and manage sequences directly in the [Dashboard](https://posthook.io/app/home).

## Usage Patterns

- [**Dead Letter Queue**](/patterns/dead-letter-queue): Handle hooks that have failed all retries.
- [**Auditing**](/patterns/auditing): Double-check important hooks ran.
- [**Recurring Tasks**](/patterns/recurring-tasks): Schedule daily reports, health checks, or database maintenance.
