The Posthook API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the **Settings** page of your project in the [Dashboard](https://posthook.io/app/home).

## X-API-Key Header

Authentication to the API is performed via the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

<Note>
  **Project Scoping**: Each API Key is tied to a **specific project**. All API requests are automatically scoped to that project. You cannot access resources from Project B while using an API Key from Project A.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Although some APIs use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, Posthook expects the key directly in the `X-API-Key` header.
</Warning>

## Example Request

```bash
curl "https://api.posthook.io/v1/hooks" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ph_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.
