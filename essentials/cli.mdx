The Posthook CLI helps you develop and test your webhooks locally.

## Installation

No global installation required. Run the CLI on-demand with `npx`.

```bash
npx posthook <command>
```

## Commands

### Login

Authenticates the CLI with your Posthook account. Prompts for your API Key (found in Dashboard Settings) and stores it locally.

```bash
npx posthook login
```

### Listen

Connects to Posthook via WebSocket and forwards incoming webhooks to a local URL.

```bash
npx posthook listen --forward <LOCAL_URL>
```

**Options**:
- `--forward <url>`: The local URL to forward requests to (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- `--api-key <key>`: (Optional) Manually specify an API key instead of using the logged-in user's key.
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logs of incoming requests.

**Example**:
```bash
npx posthook listen --forward http://localhost:8080
```
