The Posthook CLI helps you develop and test your webhooks locally.

## Installation

You don't need to install the CLI globally. You can run it on-demand using `npx`.

```bash
npx posthook <command>
```

## Commands

### Login

Authenticates your CLI with your Posthook account. This prompts for your API Key (found in Dashboard Settings) and saves it locally.

```bash
npx posthook login
```

### Listen

Connects to Posthook via WebSocket and forwards incoming webhooks to a local URL.

```bash
npx posthook listen --forward <LOCAL_URL>
```

**Options**:
- `--forward <url>`: The local URL to forward requests to (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- `--api-key <key>`: (Optional) Manually specify an API key instead of using the logged-in user's key.
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logs of incoming requests.

**Example**:
```bash
npx posthook listen --forward http://localhost:8080
```
