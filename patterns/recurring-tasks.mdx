Sequences are ideal for orchestrating recurring system-level tasks, such as daily reports, database maintenance, or health checks.

## Daily Metric Snapshots

This pattern allows you to take a "snapshot" of your key performance indicators (KPIs) every day at midnight and report them to your team.

```yaml
# Daily KPI Snapshot
snapshotRevenue:
  path: /webhooks/metrics/revenue
snapshotActiveUsers:
  path: /webhooks/metrics/active-users
notifySlack:
  path: /webhooks/notifications/slack
  requires:
    - snapshotRevenue
    - snapshotActiveUsers
```

### Why this works
1.  **Parallel Execution**: `snapshotRevenue` and `snapshotActiveUsers` capture data simultaneously.
2.  **Aggregation**: `notifySlack` waits for both snapshots to finish successfully before posting a summary.
3.  **Reliability**: Partial failures stop the reporting step, ensuring you only report complete data.

## Periodic Health Checks

You can run distributed health checks every few minutes to verify system uptime.

```yaml
# 5-min Health Check
pingServiceA:
  path: /webhooks/service-a/health
pingServiceB:
  path: /webhooks/service-b/health
pingDatabase:
  path: /webhooks/database/health
```

All checks run in parallel, giving you a comprehensive snapshot of system health at that moment.
