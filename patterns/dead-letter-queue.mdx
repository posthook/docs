The List Hooks endpoint can function as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). You can fetch all failed hooks within a specific time range, process them, and then delete them.

## Workflow

1.  **List Failed Hooks**: Use `status=failed` and filters like `postAtAfter` (e.g., "yesterday").
    ```bash
    GET /hooks?status=failed&postAtAfter=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```
2.  **Process**: Iterate through the list and handle the failures (e.g., log them, alert a team, or manually fix the data).
3.  **Delete**: Once processed, delete the hook to remove it from the queue.
    ```bash
    DELETE /hooks/{id}
    ```

<Tip>
  **Automate this with Sequences**: You can set up a recurring [Sequence Pattern](/patterns/recurring-tasks) to trigger your DLQ processing endpoint every day.

## Bulk Retry

If you had a temporary outage (e.g., your database was down), you can batch retry failures instead of deleting them.

1.  **List Failed Hooks** (as above).
2.  **Extract IDs**: Collect the `id` from each hook.
3.  **Batch Retry**:
    ```bash
    POST /hooks/retryIDs
    {
      "hookIDs": ["hook_1", "hook_2", "hook_3"]
    }
    ```
