You can use the List Hooks API to reconcile your internal state with Posthook's delivery records. This is useful for verifying that critical financial or compliance events were definitely sent.

## Workflow

1.  **List Completed Hooks**:
    ```bash
    GET /hooks?status=posted&postAtAfter=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
    ```
2.  **Verify**: Iterate through the list and compare against your own transaction logs.
3.  **Alert**: Flag any discrepancies (e.g., a transaction marked "processed" in your DB but missing a corresponding webhook).
