## What is Posthook?

Posthook is a simple API for scheduling webhooks. Set a time, provide a payload, and we deliver it to your endpoint. Full visibility into every hook from the dashboard.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Schedule a Hook
curl -X POST https://api.posthook.io/v1/hooks \
  -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "path": "/webhooks/remind",
    "postAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "data": { "user_id": "123" }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Core Features

Posthook is built around two primary use cases:

### 1. One-Time Callbacks
Schedule HTTP requests to be delivered at a specific time in the future. Ideal for:
- Sending email reminders
- Delayed job processing
- Trial expiration checks

### 2. Recurring Workflows (Sequences)
Chain multiple hooks together to create complex, time-based workflows. Sequences allow you to:
- Run steps in parallel or series
- Handle dependencies (Step B waits for Step A)
- Schedule recurring jobs
