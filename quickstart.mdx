This guide walks you through setting up Posthook, connecting your local environment, and sending your first scheduled hook.

<Tip>
  Prefer an interactive guide? You can follow this same walkthrough interactively in the [Posthook Dashboard](https://posthook.io/app/home).
</Tip>

## 1. Log In

Connect your local development server to Posthook using the CLI. This lets you receive webhooks locally without tunneling tools like ngrok.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx posthook login
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx posthook login
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx posthook login
```

</CodeGroup>

You will be prompted to enter your **API Secret Key**. You can find this in the **Settings** page of your project in the [Dashboard](https://posthook.io/app/home).

## 2. Start the Listener

Start the Posthook listener to forward webhooks to your local application.

```bash
npx posthook listen --forward http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `http://localhost:3000` with the base URL of your local server.

<Note>
  The listener connects to Posthook via WebSocket. It receives webhooks and forwards them to your specified local URL.
</Note>

## 3. Send a Test Hook

In a new terminal, schedule a test webhook to fire in 5 seconds.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.posthook.io/v1/hooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "path": "/api/webhooks",
    "postAt": "'$(date -v+5S -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")'",
    "data": {
      "user_id": "usr_123",
      "reminder_id": "rem_456"
    }
  }'
```

You can find your API Key in the **Settings** page of your project in the [Dashboard](https://posthook.io/app/home).

### Verification

Check your `posthook listen` terminal. You should see:

```
2025-01-01 12:00:00 [200 OK] POST /api/webhooks
```

And your local server logs should show the incoming request with the payload:

```json
{
  "id": "hook_01H...",
  "path": "/api/webhooks",
  "postAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:05Z",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "usr_123",
    "reminder_id": "rem_456"
  }
}
```
