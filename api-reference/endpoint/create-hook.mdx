title: 'Schedule Hook'
openapi: 'POST /hooks'

Schedule a new webhook to be sent at a specific time in the future (or immediately).

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: To verify immediate delivery, use a timestamp in the past (e.g. yesterday).

## URL Resolution

When you schedule a hook, you provide a `path` (e.g. `/webhooks/remind`).

Posthook constructs the full destination URL by combining your **Project Domain** with this `path`.

> **Destination URL** = `Project Domain` + `path`

For example, if your Project Domain is `api.myapp.com` and you schedule a hook with path `/webhooks/payment`, we will POST to `https://api.myapp.com/webhooks/payment` (Posthook enforces HTTPS).


## Usage Patterns
- [**User Engagement**](/patterns/user-engagement): Schedule event reminders and abandoned cart recovery emails.
- [**Auto-Expiry (TTL)**](/patterns/auto-expiry): Schedule the deletion of temporary resources (e.g. shared links) at the moment of creation.
- [**Recursive Polling**](/patterns/polling): Periodically check a long-running job (e.g. video encoding) until it completes.
- [**Debouncing**](/patterns/debouncing): Prevent duplicate processing by verifying event freshness.
- [**Load Smoothing**](/patterns/rate-limiting): Distribute a large batch of requests over time to avoid overwhelming your API.
