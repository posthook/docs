The Posthook API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.posthook.io/v1
```

## Authentication

The Posthook API uses API keys to authenticate requests.

```bash
X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

See the [Authentication](/essentials/authentication) guide for more details.

## Response Codes

Posthook uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | **OK** - The request resulted in a success. |
| `201` | **Created** - The resource was successfully created. |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - The request was invalid (e.g. missing required fields). |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** - The `X-API-Key` header is missing or invalid. |
| `404` | **Not Found** - The requested resource (e.g. Hook ID) does not exist. |
| `429` | **Too Many Requests** - You have exceeded your rate limits. |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** - Something went wrong on our end. |
